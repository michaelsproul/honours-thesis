One might imagine a system where each bit of syntax is defined individually and composed into a unified term, for example:

\begin{verbatim}
Inductive fn (A : Type) :=
  | TVar : nat -> fn A
  | TApp : A -> A -> fn A
  | TAbs : A -> fn A.

Inductive term :=
  | TBool : bool -> term
  | TFn : fn term -> term.
\end{verbatim}

One problem with this approach is that constructors like \texttt{TApp} no longer really make sense, as the first argument has to have type \texttt{A}, but terms like \texttt{TAbs }
