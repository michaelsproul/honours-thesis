## A Taste of Linear Logic - Wadler (1993)

Wadler introduces intuitionistic logic with emphasis on the Contraction and Weakening rules, and "alternative" rules for conjunction. He then introduces a lambda calculus based on intuitionistic logic to demonstrate the correspondence between logic and type systems. He also demonstrates the equivalence of proof-reductions and ordinary beta reduction of lambda terms. With IL firmly established, linear logic is introduced, with two forms of conjunction corresponding to the different formulations in IL. The first is A ⊗ B (both A and B), which allows both A and B to be used in future deductions. The second is A & B (choose from A and B), which is derivable from an assumption list that derives A and also derives B. Only one of A or B may be used in future deductions. Wadler's LL is based on Gerard's Logic of Unity, and distinguishes between linear and re-usable assumptions. The pling/bang operator (!) applied to a proposition A indicates an unlimited supply of A's and !A can be used to satisfy an intuitionistic assumption [A]. Pling allows IL to be encoded in LL. The distinction between `<!A>` and `[A]` is also required to prevent proof reductions from reusing linear assumptions. Finally, Wadler introduces a linear lambda calculus based on linear logic and notes the potential to de-allocate resources automatically (also, efficient mutation).

## A tutorial implementation of a dependently typed lambda calculus - Loh, McBride, Swierstra (2001)

This paper approaches dependent type systems from the perspective of a Haskell programmer. An interpreter for a simple polymorphic lambda calculus is constructed and then extended with dependent types by extending function space (->) to dependent function space (∀). Dependent data types are briefly discussed, but only in the specific cases of natural numbers and vectors. The paper's calculus is also unashamedly unsound due to the type of * being * (no infinite hierarchy as in Coq).
